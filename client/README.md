## Mojjen - There is always time for kôrv

A fullstack takeaway application built with React, TypeScript, and AWS. The project follows a package architecture for modularity and scalability, and was developed by four developers: Lam Mai, Nikki Axelsson, Stefan Mogren, and Klara Sköld. The application provides two separate frontends, one for clients and one for business staff, to optimize the user experience for each group.

## Client site

The client site allows customers to create an account and log in securely, browse a dynamic menu of dishes, view details and prices, and add items to their cart. Customers can modify their orders before checkout and place them with real time updates.

## Business site

Employees can log in with their own credentials, view incoming orders as they arrive, track their status, and mark them as completed. The interface provides a clear overview of all active orders, allowing staff to efficiently manage the workflow and real time updates ensure that staff always have the latest information on customer orders.

## Backend

The backend is fully serverless, built using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. It handles authentication, order processing, and data storage without the need for traditional server management. The serverless architecture allows for automatic scaling based on demand, and ensures fast and reliable performance for both clients and staff.
